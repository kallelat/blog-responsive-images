# How to use responsive images

In this article I'm trying to figure out how to use responsive images on a website/webapp. I'm using React+TypeScript, which is a bit overkill, but allows me to split the code into smaller components.

Technologies used:

- React with TypeScript
- Plain CSS files imported to React
- Some new HTML elements, like `<picture>` and `<source>`, plus some new attributes for `<img>`

## Initial setup and configuration

1. Create a new React app with `npx create-react-app . --template typescript`
2. Start dev server using `npm start`

If you want to follow the tutorial, please checkout to branch `initial` which can be used as a starting point.

## Common problems

TBD: one image

TBD: resolution switching problem

TBD: art direction problem

TBD: bandwidth

## Solving problems with `<picture>` element

TBD: lisää eri versiot kuvasta (muista fallback)

TBD: huomioi className reactissa

## Advanced use cases

TBD: Use new image formats

TBD: Different images for different devices

TBD: object-fit

## Summary

TBD: yhteenveto latausnopeuksista eri resoilla

TBD: SEO

TBD: parempi UX

**Feel free to browse the code, if you have any questions or improvement ideas let me know!**
